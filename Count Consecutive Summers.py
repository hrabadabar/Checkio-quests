""" Positive integers can be expressed as sums of consecutive positive integers in various ways. 
For example, 42 can be expressed as such a sum in four different ways:
(a) 3+4+5+6+7+8+9, (b) 9+10+11+12, (c) 13+14+15 and (d) 42. 
As the last solution (d) shows, any positive integer can always be 
trivially expressed as a singleton sum that consists of that integer alone.

Compute how many different ways it can be expressed as a sum of consecutive positive integers.

Input: Int.

Output: Int.

Precondition: Input is always a positive integer.
