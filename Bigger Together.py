""" Your mission here is to find a difference between the maximally positive
 and maximally negative numbers. Those numbers can be found by 
 concatenating the given array of numbers.

Letâ€™s check an example. If you have numbers 1,2,3, then 321 is the
maximum number, and 123 - is the minimum. The difference between those
numbers is 198. But if you have numbers 4, 3 and 12 then 4312 is the 
maximum number, and 1234 - is the minimum. As you can see, a simple
order is not what we are looking for here.

Input: A list of positive integers.

Output: An integer.

Precondition: All elements of the list can't be less than 0
The list can't be empty """
